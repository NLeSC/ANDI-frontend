  <h2 class="terms">TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE OF THE ADVANCED NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSTICS INFRASTRUCTURE ('ANDI') WEBSITE</h2>
  <p class="terms">
    By accessing and/or using the ANDI website you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Use.
    Please read these Terms of Use carefully.
  </p>
  <p class="terms">
    <b>
      If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you must immediately terminate your use of the ANDI website.
      You may print or save a copy of these Terms of Use for your own records.
    </b>

  <p class="terms">
    <b>0. Introduction.</b>
    The ANDI website is a new platform for neuropsychological assessment. It was developed (and is currently
    owned and maintained) by the ANDI consortium on the basis of a research project sponsored by the
    Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
  </p>
  <p class="terms">
    The ANDI website provides multi-test evaluation with modern multivariate statistical tools.
    It facilitates neuropsychological assessment with a web-based interface in order to support
    both qualified clinical practitioners and behavioral researchers.
  </p>
  <p class="terms">
    The ANDI website maintains a large database of neuropsychological tests and provides a
    platform for online multi-test evaluation. As a user, you may upload (anonymous) patient data,
    i.e. a series of neuropsychological test scores and/or behavior ratings of either a group of
    patients or of a single patient. Subsequently, the ANDI website returns a statistical report
    that documents for each patient separately a detailed, multivariate analysis of the profile
    of test scores. The report indicates whether the patient deviates from the norm (e.g.
    whether he/she is cognitively impaired), and which of the series of tests are responsible for
    this deviation from the norm (e.g. in which cognitive domains he/she is impaired).
  </p>
  <p class="terms">
    The report also gives point estimates with confidence intervals of the frequency with which
    the patientâ€™s score deviations occur in the normal population. The latter information is
    essential to decide whether there are dissociations of cognitive functions, a fundamental
    concept in clinical neuropsychology and cognitive brain research in general. Additionally,
    the report documents the size and the demographic characteristics of the sample to which the
    patient(s) was/were compared. The anonymous normative data will come from people who served as
    control subjects in numerous neuropsychological and other behavioral health investigations
    that have been conducted in the past decades. The (anonymous) patient data you uploaded is only
    used to generate the statistical report and is not stored by the ANDI website.
  </p>
  <p class="terms">
